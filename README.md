Feature Detection and Matching for Object Detection
Overview
This project aims to detect and match features between a master image and two other images of an object captured in different positions or environments. The goal is to evaluate the performance of various feature detection and matching methods, including SIFT, ORB, BRISK, BF (Brute Force), and FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors).

Project Structure
images/: Contains the master image and other images used for testing.
output/: Stores the output images demonstrating feature matches.
src/: Contains the source code for feature detection and matching.
README.md: This file.
Steps to Reproduce
Step 1: Choosing the Images
Master Image: The object is placed against a plain background.
Image 1: The object is positioned at a different angle and in varied lighting.
Image 2: The object is placed in a different environment with a cluttered background.
Step 2: Feature Detection Methods
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform): Effective at detecting distinct and robust features, especially in scenarios with varying scales and rotations.
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF): Faster alternative to SIFT, designed for real-time applications, but less effective with scale changes.
BRISK (Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key points): Efficient in detecting key points and computing binary descriptors, suitable for real-time applications.
Step 3: Feature Matching Methods
Brute Force Matcher (BF): Matches each descriptor from one image with all descriptors from the other image, retaining the best matches based on distance.
FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors): Uses tree-based indexing for faster matching, suitable for large datasets and high-dimensional descriptors.
Step 4: Results and Comparison
SIFT + BF: High-quality matches, robust but slow.
SIFT + FLANN: Accurate and faster, good for large datasets.
ORB + BF: Fast with decent matches but struggles with scale changes.
ORB + FLANN: Quick execution, suitable for real-time.
BRISK + BF: Balanced speed and accuracy.
BRISK + FLANN: Efficient and balanced.
Step 5: Output Images and Observations
Each combination resulted in an output image displaying the top matches between the master image and the other two images.
A total of 12 images were generated (6 combinations × 2 image comparisons).
Conclusion
SIFT + BF/FLANN: Most accurate matches, suitable for high-accuracy needs.
ORB: Faster but less accurate with scale and environment changes.
BRISK: Balanced speed and accuracy, ideal for moderate needs.
What Worked Well

FLANN speeding up the matching process for SIFT descriptors.
Modular code structure for easy testing of different methods.
Challenges
ORB struggled with scale variations.
High computational cost of SIFT-based methods.
Tuning the ratio test for knn matches was necessary.
